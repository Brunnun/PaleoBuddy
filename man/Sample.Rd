\alias{Sample}
\title{Constant and non-constant rate species sampling}
\usage{
Sample(S, TE, TS, rr, tMax)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{the species number to be sampled. Since \code{Sample} will be called
by a wrapper using \code{lapply}, it is through \code{S} that we apply this
function.}

\item{TE}{a vector of extinction times, usually an output of \code{BDSim}.}

\item{TS}{a vector of speciation times, usually an output of \code{BDSim}.}

\item{rr}{a sampling rate function. Can be created by \code{MakeRate} for
simplicity, but can be any time-varying function.}

\item{tMax}{the maximum simulation time, used by \code{rexp_var}.}
}
\value{
a list of occurrences for that species.
}
\description{
\code{Sample} takes a species number, a vector of speciation and extinction 
times, a sampling rate and a maximum time for simulation and returns a list
of occurrence times for each species.
